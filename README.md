This is a small spring based application for anyone looking for a hospital billing software.
JSP views for frontend, spring & MySQL for backend.
This application is deployed for a small hospital in India.
Only manual testing has been done as per need.

What need's to be improved:
Implementing spring security.
Password aren't hashed in database.
The login page is rendering without styling elements as static resources are blocked by filter. 
(I tried adding manually but it isn't working)

More instructions will be provided along with the DB scripts.
